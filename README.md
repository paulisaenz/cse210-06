# CSE 210-06
Final Project for CSE 210 - Pac-Man Game


# **Overview:**

- Pac-Man is a maze action game. The player controls the character through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts.

## **Rules:**

- Players can move up, down, left, and right. 
- Player moves using the W, S, A and D keys. 
- Player has to escape from the ghosts, while eating all the dots.
- Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when a ghost is eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze, where the ghost "regenerates" and resumes their normal activity.
- If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost.

**Requirements:**

- The program includes a README file.
- The program includes class and method comments.
